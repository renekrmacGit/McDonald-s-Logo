# 🍔 McDonald's Logo Project

> A web-based tribute to one of the most recognizable brands in the world, demonstrating clean code structure and front-end development basics.

## 📖 About the Project

This project is a front-end web development showcase that recreates the iconic McDonald's visual identity using modern web technologies. The goal of this repository is to demonstrate **proper file organization**, **separation of concerns** (HTML, CSS, JS), and **asset management** in a GitHub environment.

Instead of keeping everything in a single file, this project adopts a modular approach, simulating a professional workflow where styles, scripts, and assets are strictly separated for better maintainability and scalability.

## ✨ Key Features

* **Modular Architecture:** The project is organized into dedicated directories (`styles`, `js`, `assets`) to ensure code cleanliness.
* **Custom Styling:** Utilizes CSS3 for precise positioning, responsive images, and visual styling without relying on external frameworks.
* **Interactive Elements:** Includes vanilla JavaScript implementation to handle user interactions (e.g., click events on the logo).
* **Optimized Assets:** Images are managed within a structured `assets` folder for easy retrieval.
* **Cross-Browser Compatibility:** Designed to render correctly on all modern web browsers.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

The project is built using the core technologies of the web:

* **HTML5:** For semantic structure and layout.
* **CSS3:** For styling, colors, and visual effects.
* **JavaScript (ES6):** For adding interactivity and dynamic behavior to the page.
